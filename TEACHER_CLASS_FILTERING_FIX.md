# Teacher Class Filtering Fix

## Problem Identified

Teachers were seeing attendance data, reports, and student information for ALL classes and streams in the system, not just their assigned ones. This was a security and usability issue.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Report Cards Component (`ReportCards.tsx`)
**File:** `MINE/frontend/src/components/reports/ReportCards.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added filtering logic to only show students from the teacher's assigned classes
- Updated the class dropdown to only show assigned classes for teachers
- Added visual indicator showing which classes the teacher is assigned to
- Changed dropdown label from "Class" to "Your Assigned Classes" for teachers

**Before:** Teachers could see all students in the system
**After:** Teachers only see students from their assigned classes (e.g., Teacher Rose only sees Senior 1 Stream B students)

### 2. Attendance Analysis Component (`AttendanceAnalysis.tsx`)
**File:** `MINE/frontend/src/components/attendance/AttendanceAnalysis.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated overall attendance statistics to only count students from assigned classes
- Modified class/stream breakdown to only show assigned classes and streams
- Updated attendance trends to only count relevant students
- Added visual indicator showing assigned classes
- Restricted class and stream dropdowns to only show assigned options

**Before:** Teachers saw attendance analytics for all classes and streams
**After:** Teachers only see analytics for their assigned classes and streams

### 3. Attendance Management Component (`AttendanceManagement.tsx`)
**File:** `MINE/frontend/src/components/attendance/AttendanceManagement.tsx`

**Previously Fixed:**
- Added `'teacher'` role to the `canEdit` variable so teachers can mark/edit attendance
- Fixed Teacher Rose's assigned classes data structure

## Current Status

✅ **Teachers now only see:**
- Students from their assigned classes and streams
- Attendance data for their assigned classes
- Report cards for their assigned students
- Analytics and trends for their assigned classes
- Class/stream dropdowns limited to their assignments

✅ **Teacher Rose specifically:**
- Only sees Senior 1 Stream B students (Samuel Kato)
- Only sees attendance data for Senior 1 Stream B
- Only sees report cards for Senior 1 Stream B students
- Only sees analytics for Senior 1 Stream B

## Files Modified

1. `MINE/frontend/src/components/reports/ReportCards.tsx` - Added teacher filtering
2. `MINE/frontend/src/components/attendance/AttendanceAnalysis.tsx` - Added teacher filtering
3. `MINE/frontend/src/components/attendance/AttendanceManagement.tsx` - Previously fixed role permissions

## Components Already Properly Filtered

The following components already had proper teacher filtering and didn't need changes:
- `StudentList.tsx` - Only shows students from assigned classes
- `WeeklyReports.tsx` - Only shows class info for assigned classes

## Security and Usability Improvements

1. **Data Isolation:** Teachers can no longer see sensitive information about students they're not responsible for
2. **Focused Interface:** Teachers see only relevant data, reducing confusion and improving efficiency
3. **Role-Based Access:** Proper implementation of role-based access control
4. **Clear Indicators:** Teachers can see exactly which classes they're assigned to

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Login as Teacher Rose (`rose@school.com`)
2. Navigate to different sections:
   - **Attendance Management:** Should only show Senior 1 Stream B students
   - **Report Cards:** Should only show Senior 1 Stream B students
   - **Attendance Analysis:** Should only show analytics for Senior 1 Stream B
3. Verify that no other classes or students are visible
4. Confirm that attendance marking/editing works correctly

The system now properly restricts teachers to only see and manage data for their assigned classes and streams, improving both security and usability.
