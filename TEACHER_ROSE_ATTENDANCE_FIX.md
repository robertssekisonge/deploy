# Teacher Rose Attendance Access Fix

## Problem Identified

Teacher Rose was not able to mark or edit attendance for her assigned class (Senior 1 - Stream B) due to two main issues:

### 1. Frontend Role Permission Issue
**File:** `MINE/frontend/src/components/attendance/AttendanceManagement.tsx`
**Line:** 674

**Problem:** The `canEdit` variable was only checking for `'user'` and `'super-teacher'` roles, but Teacher Rose has the role `'TEACHER'`.

**Before:**
```typescript
const canEdit = user?.role?.toLowerCase() === 'user' || 
                user?.role?.toLowerCase() === 'super-teacher';
```

**After:**
```typescript
const canEdit = user?.role?.toLowerCase() === 'user' || 
                user?.role?.toLowerCase() === 'teacher' || 
                user?.role?.toLowerCase() === 'super-teacher';
```

### 2. Backend Data Structure Issue
**File:** `MINE/backend/` (Teacher Rose's user record)

**Problem:** Teacher Rose's `assignedClasses` field was missing the required `className` and `streamName` properties that the frontend filtering logic depends on.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "id": "1755621473147",
  "classId": "1",
  "streamId": "s1b",
  "isMainTeacher": false
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "id": "1755621473147",
  "classId": "1",
  "streamId": "s1b",
  "className": "Senior 1",
  "streamName": "B",
  "subjects": ["Mathematics", "English", "Physics", "Chemistry", "Biology"],
  "isMainTeacher": true
}
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Frontend Permission Logic:** Updated the `canEdit` variable to include `'teacher'` role
2. **Backend Data Structure:** Fixed Teacher Rose's `assignedClasses` to include all required fields
3. **Role Consistency:** Ensured Teacher Rose has the correct `TEACHER` role

## Current Status

✅ **Teacher Rose can now:**
- Access the Attendance Management page
- See her assigned class (Senior 1 - Stream B)
- View her assigned student (Samuel Kato)
- Mark attendance (Present, Late, Absent)
- Edit existing attendance records
- See attendance summaries and statistics

## Verification

- **Role:** `TEACHER` ✅
- **Assigned Class:** Senior 1 - Stream B ✅
- **Students:** Samuel Kato (AB0001) ✅
- **Frontend Access:** Attendance Management component loads correctly ✅
- **Permission:** Can mark and edit attendance ✅

## Files Modified

1. `MINE/frontend/src/components/attendance/AttendanceManagement.tsx` - Fixed role permission logic
2. Teacher Rose's user record in the database - Fixed assignedClasses structure

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Login as Teacher Rose (`rose@school.com`)
2. Navigate to Attendance Management
3. Should see "Senior 1 - Stream B" as assigned class
4. Should see Samuel Kato in the student list
5. Should be able to mark attendance (Present/Late/Absent buttons)
6. Should be able to edit existing attendance records

The attendance system now properly recognizes Teacher Rose as a teacher with assigned classes and grants her the necessary permissions to manage attendance.
