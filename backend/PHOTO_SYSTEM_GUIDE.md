# Photo System Guide for Overseer Account

## üéØ Overview

This guide explains how the photo system works in your sponsorship management system. The system now ensures that **ALL uploaded photos are permanently stored and will never disappear** when you update student records or check eligibility.

## üì∏ Three Photo Types for Sponsored Students

### 1. **Student Profile Picture** (`photo`)
- **Purpose**: Full picture of the student wanting sponsorship
- **When Required**: Always required for all students
- **Storage**: Stored in the `photo` field in the database
- **File Naming**: `student_{studentId}_{uuid}.jpg`

### 2. **Family Picture** (`familyPhoto`)
- **Purpose**: Photo with family for context and sponsorship appeal
- **When Required**: Required when `needsSponsorship` is true
- **Storage**: Stored in the `familyPhoto` field in the database
- **File Naming**: `family_{studentId}_{uuid}.jpg`

### 3. **Passport Photo** (`passportPhoto`)
- **Purpose**: Official passport-style photo for identification
- **When Required**: Required when `needsSponsorship` is true
- **Storage**: Stored in the `passportPhoto` field in the database
- **File Naming**: `passport_{studentId}_{uuid}.jpg`

## üîí Permanent Storage Guarantee

### What Was Fixed
- **Before**: Photos were being lost when updating `sponsorshipStatus` to 'eligible'
- **After**: Photos are now permanently stored and preserved during ALL updates

### How It Works
1. **Photo Upload**: Photos are immediately saved to the server's file system
2. **Database Storage**: Photo filenames are stored in the database
3. **Permanent Preservation**: Photos are never deleted unless explicitly removed
4. **Update Safety**: All student updates preserve existing photo fields
