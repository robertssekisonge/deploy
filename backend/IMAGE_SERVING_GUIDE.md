# Image Serving Guide

Your backend server now supports serving profile and family photos! Here's how it works:

## 🖼️ Photo Serving Endpoints

### 1. Direct File Access
- **URL Pattern**: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/{filename}`
- **Use Case**: Direct access to any file in the uploads directory
- **Example**: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/profile_123.jpg`

### 2. Optimized Photo Serving
- **URL Pattern**: `http://localhost:5000/photos/{filename}`
- **Use Case**: Optimized serving of profile and family photos with proper MIME types and caching
- **Example**: `http://localhost:5000/photos/family_456.png`

## 📸 Supported Image Formats
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP

## 🔧 How It Works

### Frontend Usage
```javascript
// For profile photos
const profilePhotoUrl = `http://localhost:5000/photos/${user.photo}`;

// For family photos
const familyPhotoUrl = `http://localhost:5000/photos/${student.familyPhoto}`;

// Direct uploads access
const resourceUrl = `http://localhost:5000/uploads/${resource.fileData}`;
```

### Database Fields
The system already supports these photo fields:
- **User**: `photo` field for profile photos
- **Student**: `familyPhoto` and `passportPhoto` fields

### Upload Process
1. Upload images through the existing `/api/resources` endpoint
2. Images are stored in the `uploads/` directory
3. Access them via `/photos/{filename}` or `/uploads/{filename}`

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Optimized Serving**: Proper MIME types and caching headers
2. **Security**: Files are served from a controlled directory
3. **Performance**: Static file serving is faster than API routes
4. **Caching**: 24-hour cache for better performance
5. **Error Handling**: Proper 404 responses for missing files

## 📁 File Structure
```
MINE/backend/
├── uploads/           # All uploaded files go here
│   ├── profile_1.jpg
│   ├── family_2.png
│   └── resource_3.pdf
├── src/
│   └── server.ts     # Now serves static files
└── prisma/
    └── schema.prisma # Has photo fields
```

## 🔍 Testing

1. **Start your server**: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
2. **Check the logs** - you should see the new endpoints listed
3. **Upload a photo** through your existing upload system
4. **Access it** via `/photos/{filename}` or `/uploads/{filename}`

## 💡 Tips

- Use `/photos/{filename}` for profile/family photos (better caching)
- Use `/uploads/{filename}` for direct file access
- All photos are automatically cached for 24 hours
- The system automatically detects image types and sets proper MIME types
- Missing files return proper 404 errors

Your image serving system is now ready! 🎉
